OVERVIEW:
This is a recent project I did for a church ministry. It was mainly a visually focused effort to create a website to inform about the ministry. Mobile support was valued due to the young target audience. 

TECH TALK:
Sometimes you just want to learn lower level approaches; how things really work. It's good for ya, right? So, on this project, no frameworks were used for responsive design. I wanted to dive in and learn about the CSS to make it happen. Aside from writing my own media queries, the site is just some standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

HIGHLIGHTS:
With custom JavaScript to create a "sticky header" for the menu and a plugin to send emails via JavaScript, the site was starting to come along. I added in a simple library for carosoel functinoality as well. Lastly, going with my mobile endeavor, I created a custom lay-over menu for mobile support. It was a little tricky in the JavaScript world, but it adds a nice touch in my mind.

OVERVIEW:
The Charlotte District Attorney wanted to move out of the early 2000s in their web design. While at UNC Charlotte one of the professors recommended me for the project. After some meetings making sure we get that "offcial feel," you end up with this website. 

TECH TALK:
There is just a lot of information to display on this site. Mainly, formatting was the name of the game. However, I still got a change to create a CRUD interface in PHP. Their news letters come out of a simple DB I created and wrote some admin pages to update. The articles are then dispalyed in a sortable fashion on the user-facing page. 

HIGHLIGHTS:
Working with the area District Attorney is a highlight enough. But configuring all of the CPANEL hosting was another aspect. Figuring out all of it to get the database going in their existing environment was a challenge. And I like challenges.

OVERVIEW:
Here is a full-stack endeavor that lasted several months. Contacting, I was on as the lead for a database redesign and interface creation. The company needed a rework of the DB that stores employees and related information. It's a pretty complex structure with location, people, their assignments (multiple possible) and some other aspects. For example, site can move divisions and the subsequent algorithim to run updates, took some definite persistence to write. A couple of years later, it's still in use.

DEEP DIVE:
I first rationalizaed their DB eliminating some weird and constricting design. Of course, this was along side one of their data experts so we maintained the data integrity. After, we migrated data into the new DB. Next, I wrote an interface for the adminstration website to maintain this data. Testing took a while before we released.

TECH TALK:
I remained with their perscribed tech stack using Coldfusion as a severside language and working with Microsoft tools in the DB arena. There were a lot of queires to update the various types of data along with hundreds of validation runs needed on the data.

HIGHLIGHTS:
Lastly, the menu system needed some subsequert updates. I converted the menu to be database driven and provide a webpage for menu edits. Menu items can be added, created, and menu configurations would be assigned to various groups. On done through a website. Groups are collections of users that will see the same menu.
